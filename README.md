# GItHub-for-Beginner
GitHub guide for new people , got the main commands to push or pull a repo . <br>
#### üì¢ All im trying to do is to help you avoid the pain of watching 10 min yt vedio to push ur project in 1 min .

 üö© There is a solution called GitHub desktop that you can download and it gives you a nice GUI with a good UX .

 :heavy_exclamation_mark: _for the quick promised **1min GitHub push from local to remote repo** you can skip the command introduction part_ 
## Okay lets start : 

The main important commands after `git` are:

.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **init**: the init command is used to intiate a repository called **.git** so you can start using git commands inside your local repository .

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **commit**: this command helps you saves your changes , usually followed by a parameters **-m ' '** and you should type a message that will displayed later

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **add**: the add command is used to add your local changes to your remote repository 

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **status**: this command is used to keep track the status of your files wether if they are changed-**but not commited yet (RED) / committed (GREEN)**- or not ‚îÇ   in general.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **branch**: this command is used to create a path diversity  (Having multiple routes to reach a destination) , u just create another route to code   

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **checkout**: this command works with **branch command** it shows ur current branch and **if** u add a branch name after it you switch to that branch . 

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **push**: command is used to publish new local commits on ur remote directory  , usually followed by **-u** then your branch name

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **merge**: use this command to merge two branches in the remote repository .  

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **fetch** : the fetch command downloads changes from ur remote repository  **but** it doesn't changes your **local**  working files (safe mode ‚úîÔ∏è)

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  **pull**: **in contrast of fetch command ** this command is used to update your current branch (local files) with the latest changes from your remote  repository.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  **clone**: This command downloads an existing remote repository to your local computer usually using the url your find after clicking the code icon
